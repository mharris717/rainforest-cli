# Rainforest-cli

A command line interface to interact with RainforestQA.

## Installation

    $ gem install rainforest-cli

## Basic Usage
To use the cli client, you'll need your API token from a test settings page from inside [Rainforest](https://app.rainforestqa.com/).

Run all of your tests

    rainforest run all --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

Run all in the foreground and report

    rainforest run all --fg --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

Run all tests with tag 'run-me' and abort previous in-progress runs.

    rainforest run --tag run-me --fg --conflict abort --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE 


## Options

Required:
- `--token <your-rainforest-token>` - you must supply your token (get it from any tests API tab)

The options are: 

- `--browsers ie8` or `--browsers ie8,chrome` - specficy the browsers you wish to run against. This overrides the test own settings. Valid browsers are ie8, ie9, chrome, firefox and safari.
- `--tag run-me` - only run tests which have this tag (recommended if you have lots of [test-steps](http://docs.rainforestqa.com/pages/example-test-suite.html#test_steps))!)
- `--conflict abort` - if you trigger rainforest more than once, anything running will be aborted and a fresh run started
- `--fail-fast` - fail the build as soon as the first failed result comes in. If you don't pass this it will wait until 100% of the run is done
- `--fg` - results in the foreground - this is what you want to make the build pass / fail dependent on rainforest results
